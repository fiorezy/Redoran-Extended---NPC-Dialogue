# Redoran-Extended---NPC Dialogue Addon

![Image 0](https://i.imgur.com/onOXYv3.png)

# Introduction

Hello! This addon will integrate various mods designed to expand NPC dialogue into the world of Redoran-ified Skyrim. This will be a **manual process** with various steps involving downloading, rearranging, etc. A provided megapatch will be available at the end of the guide.

A **NEW SAVE is required**.

# Installation

First of all, we're going to right-click on the left side of MO2 and highlight the "All Mods" option, then click the dropdown of "Create separator above". We'll call it **[NoDelete] [002.00] REDORAN EXTENDED - NPC DIALOGUE**. All of the following mods will be installed under this separator, and the separator itself will go just below the separator called "THE DANGER ZONE". 

All the plugins going forward will be at the very bottom, **BELOW all of the Redoran patches** but **BEFORE DynDOLOD.esp**.

## OPTIONAL (FEEL FREE TO SKIP!)

**WARNING** - Relationship Dialogue Overhaul has been known to **potentially cause crashes**. I have included it as an optional file for those who can't live without it (like me!). It's a mod that **cannot be uninstalled mid-game**, so choose wisely if you want to install this portion. You may have noticed a patch for RDO in Serana Dialogue Add-On Patch Hub, but you do not need to go back and select it. The changes in that patch are forwarded into the megapatch already. 

39.) Download [Relationship Dialogue Overhaul - RDO SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1187?tab=files&file_id=1171&nmm=1).

   - Install it under the name **[NoDelete] [002.39] Relationship Dialogue Overhaul - RDO**
   
40.) Download [Relationship Dialogue Overhaul - Update and MCM](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/44601?tab=files&file_id=237381&nmm=1).

   - Install it under the name **[NoDelete] [002.40] Relationship Dialogue Overhaul - Update and MCM**
   
41.) Download [Relationship Dialogue Overhaul - UHDAP Patch](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/44601?tab=files&file_id=182719&nmm=1).

   - Install it under the name **[NoDelete] [002.41] Relationship Dialogue Overhaul - UHDAP Patch**

42.) Download [RDO - Updated USSEP Subtitle Fixes](X) ("View raw" button).

   - Install it under the name **[NoDelete] [002.42] RDO - Updated USSEP Subtitle Fixes**

**IMPORTANT** - Move the following plugins directly ABOVE **Guard Dialogue Overhaul.esp**: Relationship Dialogue Overhaul.esp | RDO Updated.esp | RDO - Updated USSEP Subtitle Fixes.esp.

# Last Steps

   - Here's how it should look on the **left side of MO2** (ignore RDO if you skipped that part):

### Snag the megapatch from here: [ [DOWNLOAD](X) ] ("View raw" button)

Name it **[NoDelete] [002.43] Redoran Extended - NPC Dialogue Megapatch**, and place it directly AFTER [NoDelete] [002.38] M'rissi Renewed - Salt and Wind.

   - If you downloaded **Relationship Dialogue Overhaul**, download the patch as well from here: **[ [DOWNLOAD](X) ] ("View raw" button)**. Name it [NoDelete] [002.44] Redoran Extended - NPC Dialogue Megapatch - RDO Integration Patch and place is AFTER RDO and the regular megapatch. You need BOTH the regular megapatch and this patch if you plan on using RDO.

### Then you are SET! Thanks for sticking with it the entire process, enjoy your game!

   - **Currently works with [Redoran-Extended - Textures Addon](https://github.com/Foamimi/Redoran-Extended---Textures/blob/master/README.md).**

# Changelog 

**IMPORTANT** - If updating Redoran (like from v.1.0.1 to 1.0.2 for example) your load order may become a bit funky on the right side of MO2. Luckily we numbered everything while installing, so the left side of MO2 should still be in tact, but to get everything back in position for the right side, I'd suggest disabling the entire NPC Dialogue addon, then re-enabling everything again one by one. This takes a hot second, but I find this method to be the fastest (for me anyway!).
